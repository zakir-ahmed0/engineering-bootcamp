#You are given a monthly budget and some expenses and need to check if the sum of the expenses goes over budget!
#First, store the total of all expenses into a variable called total.
#Next, check if the total is greater than the budget. If it is, store True into a variable called over_budget, otherwise store False in over_budget. 

budget = 2000 

food_bill = 200
electricity_bill = 100
internet_bill = 60
rent = 1500

total = food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill + rent

if total > budget:
    over_budget = True
else:
    over_budget = False

print("Total: " + str(total))
print("Is it over budget? " + str(over_budget))
