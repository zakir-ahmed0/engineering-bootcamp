#Define a function that has three input parameters, num1, num2, and num3
#Test if num1 is greater than the other two numbers
#If so, return num1
#Test if num2 is greater than the other two numbers
#If so, return num2
#Test if num3 is greater than the other two numbers
#If so, return num3
#If there was a tie between the two largest numbers, then return "It's a tie!"

#Create a function called max_num() that has three parameters named num1, num2, and num3.

#The function should return the largest of these three numbers. If any of two numbers tie as the largest, you should return "It's a tie!".
